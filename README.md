The YOLO (Real-Time Object Detection) computer vision model is used to detect cracks, dents, or minor damage in airplanes, which could potentially lead to disasters if left unaddressed. This model also counts the number of dents present.

Additionally, the XGBoost model is employed to detect wiring faults in the aircraft, identifying any potential failures.

How it helps to solve the problem?

These technologies help solve critical safety problems in aviation. By detecting dents and cracks at early stages, YOLO prevents potential future disasters. Meanwhile, XGBoost predicts wiring faults by analyzing input values, allowing for early intervention and maintenance

Reason behind choosing a technology
Yolo: It can process images at 45 Frames Per Second (FPS). In addition, YOLO reaches more than twice the mean Average Precision (mAP) compared to other real-time systems
XGBoost has been compared to different algorithms such as random forest (RF), gradient boosting machines (GBM), and gradient boosting decision trees (GBDT). These comparisons show that XGBoost outperforms these other algorithms in execution speed and model performance.
